## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. 
- In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
- Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors. 


## Conclusions
Significant variables to predict the demand for shared bikes
holiday
temp
hum
windspeed
Season
months(January, July, September, November, December)
Year (2019)
Sunday
weathersit( Light Snow, Mist + Cloudy)

Important Points company should consider - Fall season is generally more profitable. However, company needs to focus on Spring season to boost their demand. Rain sees a drop in demand as well.
